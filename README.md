# 100-times-faster-nlp

This repository contains an iPython notebook accompanying the post **ðŸš€ 100 Times Faster Natural Language Processing in Python**.

The notebook contains all the examples of the post running in a iPython session.

Online, the notebook can be better visualized [on nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/huggingface/100-times-faster-nlp/blob/master/100-times-faster-nlp-in-python.ipynb) (Github's ipynb visualizer doesn't render well Cython interactive annotations).
